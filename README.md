# Rice Grain Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of rice grains using machine learning algorithms. It explores the effectiveness of various models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Features
- Utilizes morphological features extracted from segmented rice grain images.
- Includes preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion and Otsu's thresholding during segmentation.
- Comprehensive evaluation of models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Key Results
- KNN emerged as the highest-performing model with an accuracy of 97.80%.
- The success of the models underscores the importance of adept feature engineering and segmentation techniques.
